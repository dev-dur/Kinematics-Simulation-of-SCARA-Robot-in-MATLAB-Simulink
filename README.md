# Kinematics-Simulation-of-SCARA-Robot-in-MATLAB-Simulink
A project focused on simulating the forward and inverse kinematics of a SCARA robot using MATLAB &amp; Simulink. The SCARA (Selective Compliance Articulated Robot Arm) is widely used in pick-and-place and precision assembly applications, making it an ideal test case for academic modeling, validation, and simulation.
